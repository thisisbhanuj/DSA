/*
    RECURSION is a product of { Decision Space + Choices }, as primary aspects.
    Reduction of inputs is secondary and the side-effect of the process, hence
    the focus should be on the primary things. RECURSIVE TREE is created by
    Input - Output process, where ROOT should be initialized first,
    and the Branches are the # of Choices causing reduction of input space.

    Stress-Time Recognition Trick
    *****************************
    When under stress in an interview, immediately ask yourself:

    1. What am I building step-by-step? (state)
    ‚Üí e.g., partial configuration of board, subset, string, etc.

    2. What are the available moves/choices?
    ‚Üí e.g., next column, next number, next letter.

    3. When is the configuration complete? (base)
    ‚Üí e.g., row == N, index == nums.length, etc.

    4. Do I need to backtrack?
    ‚Üí if you‚Äôre exploring multiple branches.

        üß≠ Why We ‚ÄúUndo‚Äù Things
    ************************
    ‚ùìWhy do we undo the choice after recursion?

    Because recursion builds the solution in place (shared memory, same data structure).
    When we return from recursion, we need to restore the previous state before trying the next choice.
    So ‚Äúundo‚Äù isn‚Äôt mystical ‚Äî it‚Äôs just state restoration.

    You can visualize it like this:
        state = []
        choose A ‚Üí state = [A]
        recurse()
        undo A ‚Üí state = []
        choose B ‚Üí state = [B]
        recurse()

    If you don‚Äôt undo, all choices get mixed ‚Äî you never cleanly isolate one path of exploration.

    üîÅ The Generic Pseudocode Template
    ***********************************
        void recursion(State state) {
            if (isGoal(state)) {
                record(state);
                return;
            }

            for (Choice choice : getChoices(state)) {
                if (isValid(choice, state)) {
                    make(choice, state);     // 1Ô∏è‚É£ Choose
                    recursion(state);        // 2Ô∏è‚É£ Explore
                    undo(choice, state);     // 3Ô∏è‚É£ Un-choose
                }
            }
        }
    ***********************************

    Every recursion / backtracking problem fits into this skeleton.
    Once you articulate that in words, recursion‚Äôs code almost writes itself.
