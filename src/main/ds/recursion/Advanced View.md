### 🧩 1. The Conventional View (Reduction of Input)

Most beginners (and even many intermediate coders) think:

> “Recursion = reduce the input until a base case is reached.”

Example:

```java
int factorial(int n) {
    if (n == 0) return 1;
    return n * factorial(n - 1);
}
```

Here, the input `n` reduces by 1 → base case 0.

✅ Works, but this view is *too narrow*.
It only fits *linear recursion* (where each call has one child).
It doesn’t help you **design** recursive logic in problems like:

* Subsets / permutations
* N-Queens / Sudoku
* DFS / backtracking problems
  (where we branch into *multiple choices* at each step)

---

### 🌳 2. The Better View — “Recursion = Decision Space + Choices”

This is the *real power lens*.
You can think of recursion as a **state-space exploration** engine.

> At every recursive level, you make a *decision* from available *choices* → this creates *branches* in the recursion tree.

Each recursive call represents:

* A **state** (partial progress)
* A **decision point** (what to choose next)
* A **reduction of possibilities** (input size reduces as a *consequence*, not the goal)

🧠 In other words:

> **Recursion explores all possible decisions from a given state until termination (base case).**

### 🌱 3. Recursion Tree Intuition

Let’s take the example of generating all subsets of `[1, 2, 3]`.

At root → subset = `[]`
Choices = `{1, 2, 3}`

At each level, you *decide*:

* include element
* exclude element

Recursive Tree (conceptually):

```
                          []
                     /            \
                 [1]              []
               /     \           /     \
           [1,2]   [1]       [2]      []
          /   \     / \       / \      / \
    [1,2,3] [1,2] [1,3][1] [2,3][2] [3] []
```

Here, **reduction of input** (like moving index `i+1`) is a *result of making a decision*, not the focus.
The *focus* is exploring each decision’s consequence.

### ⚙️ 4. The “Input → Output” Process You Mentioned

Recursion is just a function that maps:

> **Input (state)** → **Output (result of exploring that state’s decisions)**

Root node = the *initial state*
Branches = *available choices*
Leaf nodes = *base cases* (no further decisions possible)

So, nderstanding that:

> “Root should be initialized first, and branches are the #choices causing input reduction”
> is 💯 correct.

It’s exactly how a **recursive tree** unfolds.

### 🧭 5. Why This Mental Model Helps Under Stress

When you face a new recursion/backtracking problem, ask yourself:

1. **State:** What represents my current state? (parameters of the function)
2. **Choices:** What are the available decisions from this state?
3. **Transition:** How do I move to the next state after choosing something?
4. **Base Case:** When do I stop?
5. **Output:** What do I collect or return at the end?

If you write these five down, the recursive structure almost *writes itself*.
