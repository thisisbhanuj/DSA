There are several approaches to solve the problem of finding the top k frequent elements in an array. 

1. Hash Map with Sorting:
    Create a frequency map using a hash map to count the occurrences of each element.
    Then sort the elements based on their frequencies and return the top k elements.
    This approach has a time complexity of O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

2. Hash Map with Min Heap:
    Similar to the previous approach, create a frequency map using a hash map.
    Instead of sorting, use a min heap to keep track of the top k frequent elements.
    Iterate through the frequency map and maintain a min heap of size k.
    If the current element has a higher frequency than the root of the min heap,
    replace the root with the current element and adjust the heap.
    Finally, the min heap will contain the top k frequent elements.
    This approach has a time complexity of O(n log k).

3. Hash Map with Counting Sort
    In general, if "k" is small compared to the number of unique elements in the input array and
    memory is not a significant concern, the Counting Sort approach might be more efficient.
    However, for larger values of "k" or when memory is a concern,
    the Max Heap approach could be a better choice.

4. Hash Map with Bucket Sort:
    Create a frequency map using a hash map.
    Then, use bucket sort to group elements based on their frequencies.
    Create an array of buckets, where each bucket represents a frequency range.
    Iterate through the frequency map and place elements in the corresponding bucket based on their frequency.
    Finally, traverse the buckets from highest to lowest frequency and collect the top k frequent elements.
    This approach has a time complexity of O(n).

5. Quickselect Algorithm:
    This approach utilizes the Quickselect algorithm,
    which is an efficient selection algorithm to find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array.
    In this case, we modify the Quickselect algorithm to find the kth largest element, which gives us the top k frequent elements.
    The Quickselect algorithm has an average time complexity of O(n) and a worst-case time complexity of O(n^2),
    but it can be optimized using various techniques like randomization or using the median of medians algorithm.
