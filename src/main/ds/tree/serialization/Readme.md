The time and space complexity of serialization and deserialization varies depending on the type of traversal used. Let's analyze the complexity for each method:

### 1. **Pre-Order Traversal**

- **Serialization**:
    - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
      We visit each node exactly once, so the time complexity is linear in the number of nodes.
    - **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
      The space required is proportional to the number of nodes due to the recursive call stack (in the case of recursive implementation) and the storage for the serialized string.

- **Deserialization**:
    - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
      Each node is processed once, so the time complexity is linear.
    - **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
      The space is used for the reconstructed tree and the recursive call stack during deserialization.

### 2. **In-Order Traversal**

- **Serialization**:
    - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
      Similar to pre-order, each node is visited once.
    - **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
      The space required includes the call stack (in case of recursive implementation) and the serialized string.

- **Deserialization**:
    - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
      While processing each node is linear, determining the structure of the tree requires additional information (like pre-order or post-order traversal), potentially increasing complexity.
    - **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
      The complexity includes the space for the reconstructed tree and the auxiliary data structures (like another traversal array).

### 3. **Post-Order Traversal**

- **Serialization**:
    - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
      Each node is visited once.
    - **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
      The space is required for the recursive call stack and the serialized string.

- **Deserialization**:
    - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
      Processing is linear, starting from the last element (root) and reconstructing the tree.
    - **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
      The space complexity accounts for the tree itself and the recursive call stack.

### 4. **Level-Order Traversal (BFS)**

- **Serialization**:
    - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
      Each node is processed exactly once using a queue, so the complexity is linear.
    - **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
      The space is required for the queue (which stores nodes at each level) and the serialized string.

- **Deserialization**:
    - **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
      Each node is processed once while reconstructing the tree.
    - **Space Complexity**: \( O(n) \)  
      The space is required for the queue during deserialization and the reconstructed tree.

### Comparison Summary

- **Time Complexity**: For all traversal methods (Pre-Order, In-Order, Post-Order, Level-Order), the time complexity is \( O(n) \) for both serialization and deserialization because each node in the binary tree is visited exactly once.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also \( O(n) \) for all traversal methods, but there are some differences:
    - Pre-Order and Post-Order: Space is consumed primarily by the call stack during recursion and the storage of the serialized string.
    - In-Order: Requires additional space if combined with another traversal method for deserialization.
    - Level-Order: The queue used in BFS consumes extra space during both serialization and deserialization.

In general, **Pre-Order** and **Post-Order** are more straightforward and efficient for tree reconstruction, especially when used alone. **Level-Order** is also efficient but slightly more complex in terms of space due to the queue. **In-Order** alone is insufficient for tree reconstruction without additional traversal data.
