Red-Black Trees and AVL Trees are both self-balancing binary search trees, but they differ in how they maintain balance and how they trade off between balancing and performance.

### 1. **Balance Criteria**
- **AVL Tree**: Strictly balanced. The heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most 1. If the difference becomes more than 1, rotations are performed to maintain balance.
- **Red-Black Tree**: Less strictly balanced. It uses a set of properties (involving node colors) to ensure that the longest path (from root to leaf) is no more than twice the shortest path. The balance is maintained through color changes and rotations.

### 2. **Rotations**
- **AVL Tree**: Since it maintains stricter balance, it requires more frequent rotations (single or double) during insertions and deletions.
- **Red-Black Tree**: Fewer rotations are needed compared to AVL trees. Rotations occur only during insertions or deletions that violate the Red-Black properties, which makes insertions and deletions generally faster.

### 3. **Search Operations**
- **AVL Tree**: The stricter balancing leads to more consistent O(log n) time complexity for search operations because the tree height is guaranteed to be lower than that of a Red-Black Tree.
- **Red-Black Tree**: Search operations are also O(log n), but the tree can be taller than an AVL tree due to the less strict balancing, potentially leading to slightly slower search performance in the worst case.

### 4. **Insertion and Deletion**
- **AVL Tree**: Both operations require rebalancing, which may involve multiple rotations. This makes insertions and deletions slightly slower compared to Red-Black Trees.
- **Red-Black Tree**: Fewer rotations and rebalancing steps are required, making insertion and deletion operations generally faster.

### 5. **Use Cases**
- **AVL Tree**: Preferred when search operations are more frequent than insertions or deletions since it guarantees faster lookups.
- **Red-Black Tree**: More suited for situations where insertion and deletion operations are more frequent, as it offers faster average performance for these operations due to fewer rotations.

### 6. **Tree Height**
- **AVL Tree**: Height is tightly bound, with a maximum height of about `1.44 * log2(n)`.
- **Red-Black Tree**: Height can be up to `2 * log2(n)` in the worst case, which is less tightly controlled but still logarithmic.

### Summary
- **AVL Trees** provide faster lookups due to tighter height constraints but at the cost of slower insertions and deletions.
- **Red-Black Trees** offer better performance for insertions and deletions with a slight trade-off in lookup performance.

The choice between the two often depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the frequency of insertions/deletions versus lookups.
