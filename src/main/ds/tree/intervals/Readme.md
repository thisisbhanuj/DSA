In the context of tree data structures, intervals or overlapping intervals can be handled in several ways, depending on the specific problem. Here are common approaches:

1. **Segment Trees**:
    - **Use Case**: Efficient querying and updating of intervals or ranges.
    - **Structure**: Each node represents an interval or segment of the data.
    - **Operations**: Allows range queries, updates, and queries for overlapping intervals.

2. **Interval Trees**:
    - **Use Case**: Specifically designed to handle overlapping intervals and range queries.
    - **Structure**: Each node represents an interval and stores additional information to facilitate overlap queries.
    - **Operations**: Provides efficient querying for intervals that overlap with a given interval.

3. **Balanced Binary Search Trees (e.g., AVL Trees)**:
    - **Use Case**: Handling intervals where you need to maintain a sorted order based on interval endpoints.
    - **Structure**: Nodes can store interval endpoints, and tree operations ensure that intervals are sorted and balanced.
    - **Operations**: Allows insertion, deletion, and querying based on interval properties.

**Optimizations**:
- For **Segment Trees**, lazy propagation can optimize range updates.
- For **Interval Trees**, augmenting nodes with additional data like maximum end time can speed up overlap queries.

**Which to check first**: Start with Interval Trees if your primary focus is on handling and querying overlapping intervals directly.
