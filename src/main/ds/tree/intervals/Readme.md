In the context of tree data structures, intervals or overlapping intervals can be handled in several ways, depending on the specific problem. Here are common approaches:

**Which to check first**: Start with Interval Trees if your primary focus is on handling and querying overlapping intervals directly.

There are several other data structures used for handling interval-related problems, each with different strengths and use cases. Here are some notable ones:

### 1. **Segment Tree**

- **Description**: A segment tree is a binary tree used for storing intervals or segments. It allows querying and updating interval-based information efficiently.
- **Strengths**:
   - Efficient range queries (e.g., finding all intervals that overlap with a given interval).
   - Suitable for static and dynamic interval queries.
- **Use Cases**:
   - Range minimum/maximum queries.
   - Range sum queries.
   - Dynamic interval updates.

### 2. **Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree)**

- **Description**: A binary indexed tree (BIT) is a data structure that provides efficient methods for querying prefix sums and updates. Itâ€™s more common for range queries but can be adapted for interval problems.
- **Strengths**:
   - Efficient point updates and prefix sum queries.
   - Space-efficient compared to segment trees.
- **Use Cases**:
   - Prefix sums.
   - Range queries where intervals are transformed into point updates.

### 3. **Range Trees**

- **Description**: Range trees are multidimensional binary search trees designed for efficiently querying multidimensional ranges. They can handle 2D and higher-dimensional ranges.
- **Strengths**:
   - Efficient queries on multi-dimensional intervals.
   - Suitable for range queries in more than one dimension.
- **Use Cases**:
   - 2D or higher-dimensional range queries (e.g., spatial databases).

### 4. **Interval Tree with Augmented Data Structures**

- **Description**: Sometimes, interval trees can be augmented with additional structures to handle specific types of queries or updates more efficiently. For example, combining interval trees with balanced binary search trees or hash maps.
- **Strengths**:
   - Can be customized to handle specific requirements (e.g., counting intervals, handling updates).
- **Use Cases**:
   - Advanced interval operations or optimizations.

### 5. **Sweep Line Algorithm with Active Intervals**

- **Description**: This approach involves "sweeping" a line across the plane and maintaining a list of active intervals. Events are processed in sorted order.
- **Strengths**:
   - Effective for problems involving intersections or overlaps in computational geometry.
   - Often used in conjunction with balanced trees or priority queues.
- **Use Cases**:
   - Computational geometry problems.
   - Overlapping interval problems in 2D or higher dimensions.

### 6. **Interval Trees**:
- **Use Case**: Specifically designed to handle overlapping intervals and range queries.
- **Structure**: Each node represents an interval and stores additional information to facilitate overlap queries.
- **Operations**: Provides efficient querying for intervals that overlap with a given interval.

### Summary

- **Segment Trees**: Useful for range queries and updates.
- **Binary Indexed Trees**: Efficient for prefix sums and range queries in certain contexts.
- **Range Trees**: Ideal for multi-dimensional range queries.
- **Augmented Interval Trees**: Customizable for specific interval operations.
- **Sweep Line Algorithm**: Effective for geometric problems involving intervals.

Each data structure has its advantages depending on the specific problem and query requirements, so choosing the right one depends on the nature of the interval queries and updates you need to handle.
