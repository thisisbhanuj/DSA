
**Problem: Social Network Analysis - Influencer Detection**

In today's world of social media, social networks play a significant role in connecting people and
shaping opinions. One interesting problem is to identify influencers or key individuals who have a substantial impact on the network.

Given a social network represented as a directed graph,
where each node represents an individual and edges represent connections (e.g., friendships, follows);
design an algorithm to detect the influencers in the network.

**Steps:**
1. Start by constructing the graph using the provided data (e.g., friendships, followers, etc.).
2. Perform a traversal algorithm (e.g., Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search) to explore the network.
3. Assign a score to each node based on its influence, such as the number of followers, the number of interactions, or other relevant metrics.
4. Identify the top k nodes with the highest influence scores as the influencers in the network.

**Use Case:**
This problem is highly relevant in the context of social media marketing and brand promotions.
Identifying influencers can help businesses target their marketing efforts effectively by leveraging the reach and
influence of these key individuals to promote their products or services.

**Challenges:**
The challenges in this problem lie in dealing with large-scale social networks,
where the graph can be massive and constantly evolving.
Efficient graph algorithms and data structures are required to handle such scenarios and process the data in real-time.

Please note that while social network analysis and influencer detection are well-studied topics,
the specific context and data provided in real-world scenarios can make the problem unique and challenging.
The implementation can be further customized based on the available data and requirements.

Keep in mind that the problem mentioned above is just one example of a unique graph-related problem relevant to today's world.
There are various other applications of graph theory in diverse fields
such as recommendation systems, transportation optimization, epidemiology and more.
The unique challenges and use cases in these domains make them interesting and worthy of exploration.
