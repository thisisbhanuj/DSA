Sure, let's dive into Topological Sorting!

Topological sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
The idea is to start with a node that has no incoming edges, and continue removing nodes from the graph along with their outgoing edges.

There are two popular algorithms to perform topological sort:

1. **Kahn's Algorithm (BFS based):**
This algorithm works by choosing vertices in the same order as the final topological sort.
It starts by identifying vertices that have no incoming edges (i.e., indegree = 0).
These vertices are added to the topological sort and removed from the graph.
The process is repeated until all vertices are removed.

2. **DFS based Algorithm:**
In this method, we use a temporary stack.
We start from a node, we first print it and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent nodes.
But, instead of printing it immediately, we first recursively call topological sort for all its adjacent nodes, then push it to a stack.
Finally, print the contents of the stack.

The time complexity for both the Kahn's algorithm and the Depth-First Search (DFS) based algorithm is \(O(V + E)\)

1. **Kahn's Algorithm:**
This algorithm is particularly useful when you need to provide a valid topological ordering
(if one exists) even if the graph is not a DAG.
If the graph is not a DAG, Kahn's algorithm will return
an ordering that satisfies as many precedence constraints as possible.
This characteristic can be useful in certain use cases,
such as course scheduling, where you might want to provide a "best-effort" schedule
even if some prerequisites are impossible to satisfy.

2. **DFS based Algorithm:**
It assumes that the graph is a DAG and will fail if the graph contains any cycles.
This method is simpler and more intuitive, especially for those already familiar with DFS.
However, it doesn't handle non-DAGs gracefully.

So the choice between Kahn's algorithm and the DFS-based algorithm depends
on whether or not you can guarantee that your graph is a DAG.
If the graph may not be a DAG, Kahn's algorithm is the better choice.
If the graph is definitely a DAG, then you can use either algorithm.
